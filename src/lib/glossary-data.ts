    title: "Why This Glossary Exists: Consecrating Our Language",
    body: "The language we use to understand Scripture has been corrupted over millennia. Pagan names for days, months, and even the Creator have replaced the original Hebrew terms, subtly distancing us from the true context of the Bible. This glossary is a step toward restoration. It is an effort to reclaim the original, consecrated vocabulary of our faith, allowing us to see the Scriptures through a clearer, more accurate lens. This is not merely about using different words; it's about realigning our understanding with the linguistic and cultural world of the prophets and apostles."
