    title: "Why This Glossary Exists: Consecrating Our Language",
    body: "The language we use to understand Scripture has been corrupted over millennia. Pagan names for days, months, and even the Creator have replaced the original Hebrew terms, subtly distancing us from the true context of the Bible. This glossary is a step toward restoration. It is an effort to reclaim the original, consecrated vocabulary of our faith, allowing us to see the Scriptures through a clearer, more accurate lens. This is not merely about using different words; it's about realigning our understanding with the linguistic and cultural world of the prophets and apostles."

  "TERMS": {
    "Yahuah": {
        "hebrew": "יהוה",
        "definition": "The personal, memorial Name of the Creator of the heavens and the earth. It is the Name by which He desires to be remembered throughout all generations.",
        "context": "This Name was removed from most Bible translations and replaced with titles like 'the LORD' or 'God'. Restoring it is a foundational step in honoring the Father.",
        "restorationNote": "We restore the Name Yahuah to give Him the esteem He is due and to call on Him as He commanded.",
        "scripturalWitness": "Exodus 3:15, 'And Elohim said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, Yahuah Elohim of your fathers... hath sent me unto you: this is my name for ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations.'"
    },
    "Yahusha": {
        "hebrew": "יְהוֹשֻׁעַ",
        "definition": "The restored Hebrew Name of the Messiah. It means 'Yahuah is Salvation'.",
        "context": "The name 'Jesus' is a modern English transliteration from Greek, which does not carry the original meaning. 'Yahusha' directly connects the Son with the Father's saving power.",
        "restorationNote": "Restoring the Name Yahusha clarifies His identity and mission as the salvation provided by the Father, Yahuah.",
        "scripturalWitness": "Matthew 1:21, 'And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Yahusha: for he shall save his people from their sins.'"
    },
     "Elohim": {
        "hebrew": "אֱלֹהִים",
        "definition": "A Hebrew title for the Creator, often translated as 'God'. It is a plural noun but is used with singular verbs when referring to Yahuah, indicating majesty and supremacy (a plural of majesty).",
        "context": "While 'God' is a common term, 'Elohim' is the original title used in Genesis 1 and throughout the Tanakh (Old Testament).",
        "restorationNote": "Using 'Elohim' helps differentiate between the singular, true Creator and the generic term 'gods' used for pagan deities.",
        "scripturalWitness": "Genesis 1:1, 'In the beginning Elohim created the heaven and the earth.'"
    },
    "Ha'Mashiach": {
        "hebrew": "הַמָּשִׁיחַ",
        "definition": "The Hebrew title meaning 'The Anointed One'. It is the equivalent of the Greek word 'Christos', from which 'Christ' is derived.",
        "context": "'Christ' has become more of a name than a title in modern usage. 'Ha'Mashiach' restores its original meaning as a title signifying Yahusha's role as the anointed King and High Priest.",
        "restorationNote": "Using this title emphasizes Yahusha's function and office as the one set apart by Yahuah for His purpose.",
        "scripturalWitness": "Psalm 2:2, 'The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against Yahuah, and against his Anointed (Mashiach)...'"
    },
     "Ruach Ha'Kodesh": {
        "hebrew": "רוּחַ הַקֹּדֶשׁ",
        "definition": "The Hebrew term for 'The Set-Apart Spirit' or 'Holy Spirit'. 'Ruach' means wind, breath, or spirit.",
        "context": "This term emphasizes the Spirit's nature as the very breath and active presence of Yahuah, setting people and things apart for His purpose.",
        "restorationNote": "Restores the Hebraic understanding of the Spirit as the power and presence of Yahuah, rather than a separate, third entity.",
        "scripturalWitness": "Psalm 51:11, 'Cast me not away from thy presence; and take not thy Ruach Ha'Kodesh from me.'"
    },
    "Torah": {
        "hebrew": "תּוֹרָה",
        "definition": "Literally means 'instruction' or 'direction'. It refers to the first five books of the Bible (Genesis to Deuteronomy).",
        "context": "Often translated as 'Law', which can imply a harsh, legalistic system. 'Instruction' better captures the sense of a loving Father guiding His children.",
        "restorationNote": "Re-framing 'Law' as 'Torah' helps believers see it not as a burden, but as Yahuah's life-giving instructions for how to walk in covenant with Him.",
        "scripturalWitness": "Psalm 119:1, 'Blessed are the undefiled in the way, who walk in the Torah of Yahuah.'"
    },
    "Ekklesia": {
        "hebrew": "",
        "definition": "The original Greek word translated as 'Church'. It means a 'called-out assembly' or a 'gathering of citizens'.",
        "context": "The modern word 'church' often refers to a building, a denomination, or a religious corporation. 'Ekklesia' refers to the people themselves—the body of believers called out from the world.",
        "restorationNote": "Using 'Ekklesia' shifts the focus from a religious institution to the living, breathing community of the faithful.",
        "scripturalWitness": "Matthew 16:18, '...upon this rock I will build my Ekklesia; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.'"
    },
    "364-Day Calendar": {
      "hebrew": "",
      "definition": "The solar calendar described in the Book of Enoch and Jubilees, consisting of 12 months, 4 quarters of 91 days each (30+30+31), and totaling exactly 52 weeks. It ensures that all dates, Sabbaths, and Feasts fall on the same day of the week every year.",
      "context": "This calendar was used by the Qumran community and is considered by some to be the original, uncorrupted calendar of Creation, as opposed to the lunar-based calendars adopted later.",
      "restorationNote": "Restoring this calendar re-aligns our worship with the appointed times as they were originally set, breaking from Babylonian and Roman traditions.",
      "scripturalWitness": "Jubilees 6:32, 'And command thou the children of Israel that they observe the years according to this reckoning— three hundred and sixty-four days, and (these) will constitute a complete year...'"
    },
    "Babylonian": {
      "hebrew": "",
      "definition": "Pertaining to the ancient empire of Babylon, whose pagan religious and cultural systems heavily influenced Israel during their captivity. Many modern religious traditions, including names for months (Nisan, Tammuz) and the concept of a new year in the autumn, have their roots in Babylonian practice.",
      "context": "The prophets consistently warned Israel against adopting the ways of Babylon.",
      "restorationNote": "A key part of restoration is identifying and removing these Babylonian influences from our worship and understanding of time.",
      "scripturalWitness": "Jeremiah 10:2, 'Thus saith Yahuah, Learn not the way of the heathen...'"
    },
     "Roman": {
      "hebrew": "",
      "definition": "Pertaining to the Roman Empire, which established the Julian and later Gregorian calendars. Roman culture is the source of the pagan names for the days of the week (Sunday, Monday, etc.) and months (January, March, etc.), which honor their gods.",
      "context": "The Roman system of timekeeping, enforced by figures like Constantine, cemented the departure from the Biblical calendar for much of the world.",
      "restorationNote": "To restore true time, we must reject the Roman naming conventions for days and months, which are rooted in idolatry.",
      "scripturalWitness": "Daniel 7:25, 'And he shall speak great words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws...'"
    },
    "Redeem the Days": {
      "hebrew": "",
      "definition": "The act of reclaiming time for Yahuah's purposes. It involves consciously choosing to live by His calendar and observe His appointed times, rather than following the corrupted timekeeping systems of the world.",
      "context": "This is a spiritual discipline of prioritizing Yahuah's rhythm over the world's rhythm.",
      "restorationNote": "By using the 364-day calendar, we are actively participating in 'redeeming the days.'",
      "scripturalWitness": "Ephesians 5:16, 'Redeeming the time, because the days are evil.'"
    },
    "lunar cycles": {
      "hebrew": "",
      "definition": "A method of timekeeping based on the phases of the moon. Modern Rabbinic Judaism uses a luni-solar calendar, which requires adding a 'leap month' (Adar II) periodically to stay aligned with the solar year. This system causes the Feasts to drift.",
      "context": "The books of Enoch and Jubilees explicitly warn against following the moon for calendar purposes, stating it leads to error.",
      "restorationNote": "The 364-day calendar is purely solar, rejecting lunar phases as the basis for calculating months or years, thereby maintaining perfect consistency.",
      "scripturalWitness": "Enoch 74:12, 'And the sun and the stars bring in all the years exactly, so that they do not advance or delay their position by a single day unto eternity; but complete the years with perfect justice in 364 days.'"
    },
    "Gregorian model": {
        "hebrew": "",
        "definition": "The internationally accepted civil calendar, introduced by Pope Gregory XIII in 1582. It is a solar calendar with 365.2425 days, which it corrects through a complex system of leap years. Its days and months are named after Roman gods and emperors.",
        "context": "This is the default calendar of the modern world, but it is not the calendar of Scripture. Its structure causes the weekly Sabbath to float across different dates each year.",
        "restorationNote": "Abandoning the Gregorian model for worship and timekeeping is a necessary step in returning to the path of truth.",
        "scripturalWitness": "Daniel 7:25 prophesied that a power would 'think to change times and laws,' a prophecy many believe was fulfilled by the Roman system that produced the Gregorian calendar."
    },
    "Shabbat": {
        "hebrew": "שַׁבָּת",
        "definition": "The seventh day of the week, a holy day of rest and convocation commanded by Yahuah. It is a perpetual sign of the covenant between the Creator and His people.",
        "context": "In the 364-day calendar, the Sabbath is always fixed to the 7th, 14th, 21st, and 28th days of every month, demonstrating its unchanging nature.",
        "restorationNote": "Referred to as 'Weekly Sabbath' in this calendar to distinguish it from 'High Sabbaths.' The name 'Saturday' is of pagan origin (Saturn's Day) and should be avoided.",
        "scripturalWitness": "Exodus 20:8, 'Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.'"
    },
    "Mo'edim": {
        "hebrew": "מוֹעֲדִים",
        "definition": "Plural of Moed. The set-apart, 'appointed times' of Yahuah. These are divine appointments and prophetic rehearsals, not just 'holidays' or 'festivals'.",
        "context": "The Mo'edim include the weekly Sabbath as well as the seven annual feasts.",
        "restorationNote": "Understanding these days as divine appointments, rather than just cultural holidays, is key to their proper observance.",
        "scripturalWitness": "Leviticus 23:4, 'These are the feasts of Yahuah, even holy convocations, which ye shall proclaim in their seasons.'"
    },
    "Tekufah": {
      "hebrew": "תְּקוּפָה",
      "definition": "Literally 'turning' or 'circuit.' Refers to the four seasonal turning points of the year. In the 364-day calendar, these are the four extra 'transitional days' added to the end of each 91-day quarter (on Months 3, 6, 9, 12), ensuring the calendar stays aligned with the solar cycle.",
      "context": "These are not counted as days of the week, allowing the 52-week cycle to remain perfect. They are days of transition between seasons.",
      "restorationNote": "Modern calendars use a 'leap day' every four years. The Tekufah system uses one transitional day every quarter to maintain solar alignment annually.",
      "scripturalWitness": "Enoch 82:4–6 describes the four leaders of the seasons who 'discharge their duties' on these transitional days."
    },
    "Moed": {
      "hebrew": "מוֹעֵד",
      "definition": "An 'appointed time' or 'divine appointment' set by Yahuah. These are not merely 'holidays' but are prophetic rehearsals of Yahuah’s plan of salvation. The weekly Sabbath and the seven annual feasts are Moedim.",
      "context": "The Moedim are fixed points in time, established at Creation, for humanity to meet with the Creator.",
      "restorationNote": "Observing the Moedim on their correct, calculated days is a central part of restoring the covenant path.",
      "scripturalWitness": "Leviticus 23:2, 'Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, Concerning the feasts of Yahuah, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, even these are my feasts.'"

    "Weekly Sabbath": {
      "hebrew": "שַׁבָּת",
      "definition": "The 7th day of the week, a perpetual sign of the covenant between Yahuah and His people. In the 364-day calendar, the Sabbath is always fixed to the 7th, 14th, 21st, and 28th day of every month.",
      "context": "The 364-day calendar's perfect 52-week cycle means the Sabbath never 'floats' as it does in the Gregorian calendar.",
      "restorationNote": "This restores the Sabbath to its immutable, mathematical position in time, proving it is not dependent on the lunar cycle.",
      "scripturalWitness": "Genesis 2:3, 'And Elohim blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which Elohim created and made.'"
    },
    "High Sabbath": {
      "hebrew": "",
      "definition": "A special annual feast day that is observed like a weekly Sabbath, with rest and a holy convocation, regardless of the day of the week it falls on in other calendars. In the 364-day calendar, most High Sabbaths coincide with weekly Sabbaths or other significant days.",
      "context": "Examples include the first and last day of Unleavened Bread, Shavuot, Yom Teru'ah, Yom Kippur, and the first day of Sukkot.",
      "restorationNote": "The 364-day calendar often aligns these High Sabbaths with the weekly Sabbath, removing the 'double Sabbath' confusion found in other systems.",

      "definition": "The day the lamb was to be slain. It commemorates the deliverance from Egypt and prophetically points to the crucifixion of Yahusha, the Lamb of Elohim.",
      "context": "This is a memorial, not a High Sabbath. It occurs on the 14th day of the first month.",
      "restorationNote": "Passover is the event that begins the 7-day Feast of Unleavened Bread, but it is distinct from it.",
      "scripturalWitness": "Exodus 12:6, 'And ye shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month: and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening.'"

    "Feast of Unleavened Bread": {
      "hebrew": "חַג הַמַּצּוֹת",
      "definition": "A seven-day feast following Passover, where no leaven (yeast) is consumed. It prophetically represents Yahusha’s sinless life and His burial, and our call to walk in sincerity and truth.",
      "context": "The first and last days (Day 15 and Day 21 of Month 1) are High Sabbaths.",
      "restorationNote": "Leaven represents sin and false doctrine. This feast is a call to purge spiritual corruption from our lives.",

      "hebrew": "יוֹם הַבִּכּוּרִים",
      "definition": "The offering of the first of the barley harvest. Prophetically, this is the day Yahusha was resurrected from the dead, as the 'first fruits' of those who have fallen asleep.",
      "context": "It occurs on the first day of the week (Yom Rishon) after the weekly Sabbath that falls during the Feast of Unleavened Bread. In the 364-day calendar, this is always Month 1, Day 16.",
      "restorationNote": "This day's fixed position in the 364-day calendar proves the resurrection was on a specific, countable day, not a floating 'Easter Sunday'.",

    "Feast of Weeks (Shavuot)": {

      "definition": "Occurs 50 days after First Fruits (by counting 7 Sabbaths plus one day). It celebrates the giving of the Torah at Sinai and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit in Acts 2. It represents the writing of the Law on our hearts.",
      "context": "In the 364-day calendar, this is always on Month 3, Day 15, a High Sabbath.",
