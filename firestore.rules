/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the Calendar application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a user-ownership model for user settings, ensuring that only the authenticated user can access their own settings.
 * Calendar events, glossary terms, and podcast series are treated as public data, accessible to all users.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - User settings are stored under `/users/{userId}/settings/{settingsId}`.
 * - Calendar events are stored under `/calendar_events/{calendarEventId}`.
 * - Glossary terms are stored under `/glossary_terms/{glossaryTermId}`.
 * - Podcast series are stored under `/podcast_series/{podcastSeriesId}`.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User settings are strictly controlled via path-based ownership.
 * - Calendar events, glossary terms, and podcast series are publicly readable and writable.
