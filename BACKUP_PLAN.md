# Project Backup Plan

To create a complete backup of your project, you should save the following files and directories. These contain all of your essential source code, configurations, and assets.

You can safely ignore directories like `node_modules` and `.next`, as they are generated automatically when you install dependencies and build the project.

## Essential Files and Directories to Back Up:

- **`src/`**: The entire source code of your application.
- **`public/`**: All static assets like images, fonts, etc.
- **`docs/`**: Contains `backend.json` and other documentation.

### Root Configuration Files:

- `apphosting.yaml`
- `components.json`
- `firestore.rules`
- `next.config.mjs`
- `package.json`
- `package-lock.json`
- `postcss.config.mjs`
- `tailwind.config.ts`
- `tsconfig.json`
- `.env`
- `.gitignore`
- `README.md`
